## Vagrant Setup

This tutorial guides you through creating your K8s VM lab.

We start with a generic Ubuntu VM, and use bash script to:
* install packages for git, golang, ...   
* create user accounts, and add ssh publish key
* config host name  
* config static ip

Afterwards, we'll see how easy it is to package our newly provisioned VM
environment into a new "Vagrant box", which can be instantly deployed for new
projects, and shared with others.
